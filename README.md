# Simple Auth Web App

This is a basic fullstack app that uses a database, backend and frontend to allow users to create an account, login, recover and delete their account. The goal is to try to build it in one day but circumstances are less than ideal so I will try to build it in three days. Readme will be updated with technologies used and other necessary information as the project progresses.
